### there are many docker images available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com), we can just pull them & start running containers

# Get Images from `DockerHub`
```
docker pull tomcat:latest      -- to pull a docker image from docker hub	

docker image ls                -- to display the images on your local machine
docker inspect tomcat:latest   -- to view the detaied information in JSON output
docker image rm tomcat:latest  -- to remove a image from local machine
docker image prune -a          -- to remove all unused images from local machine
```	

# how to run containers from a docker image 

### two ways we can run the images 

## run a container in `foreground mode`  
```
docker run tomcat:latest 

Note: 
-- the terminal will be stuck after running above commnd
-- use Ctrl + C to come out 
```
## run a container in `detached mode`
```
docker run -d nginx:latest

Note:
-- always creates new container & detaches from the terminal you are working on ( goes in background process )) 
```

## how to see running/stopped containers 
```
docker ps      -- to see all running containers 
docker ps -a   -- to see all running and exited/stopped containers
```

## container LifeCycle 
```
docker stop <container id>              -- to stop a container 
docker start <container id>             -- to start a stopped container 
docker restart <container id>           -- to restart a container 
docker rm <container id>                -- to remove a stopped/exited container
docker rm -f <container id>             -- to remove a container forcefully though it is in running state 
docker inspect <container id>           -- to view detailed information about the continaer in JSON format
