## how to access the applications running inside the container `from external world (browser)`
	
> **services running inside a container can never be accessed direcltry, we always need to publish/expose them on to docker host while we create the containers** 
	
> **we need to publish/expose the services using `-P (capital)` OR `-p (small)` with in the docker run command** 
	
## use `-P ( capital )` 

### Create a Container & Publish 
```	
docker run -d -P nginx 
  -- docker will publish/expose the port number dynamically on docker host & maps with port running inside the cont

docker ps 
  -- to check the container port 
```
### Access Application
```
to access: 
-- in the browser http://<docker-host-IP>:<exposed port>  
-- ex: http://52.14.62.88:32768
```	

## use `-p ( small )` 

### Create a Container & Publish 
```	
docker run -d -p 9090:80 nginx 
  -- docker will publish/expose the port numbr as defined on docker host & maps with port running inside the cont

docker ps 
  -- to check the container port 
```
### Access Application
```
to access: 
-- in the browser http://<docker-host-IP>:<exposed port>  
-- ex: http://52.14.62.88:9090
```
