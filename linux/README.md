## Operating System definition

> An OS is a collection of s/w programs. It mainly controls the allocation and usage of h/w resources such as memory, CPU time, hard disk space etc.

> All application programs use the OS to gain access to these hardware resources as and when they are needed. 

> The OS is the 1st program to be loaded into the computer when it boots & it remains in memory at all times thereafter.

## Types of Operating System

> Single user OS – this OS supports 1 user at a time. The user can perform one task as well as multiple tasks on the OS.
* ** For ex, MS – DOS, MS – Windows**
> Multi - user OS – in this OS, multiple users can execute single task or multiple tasks at any given point of time. 
* **For ex, UNIX, LINUX, Windows Server OS**

## ARCHITECTURE of an OS

> An OS is made up of 2 components, known as,
 
* Shell
* Kernel

![Architecture](https://github.com/lerndevops/labs/blob/master/static/linux_architecture.jpeg)
 
> The kernel is the core of an OS which manages the entire system resources The shell acts as an interface between kernel and end user or application.

> In UNIX OS, the shell is very protective – hence it is more secure. Whereas, in WINDOWS, the shell is less protective and more good in usability.

> UNIX was originally called MULTICS (Multiplexed Information & Computing Systems). 

> Then it changed to UNICS (Uniplexed Information & Computing Systems). Then it changed to UNIX – Extended version of UNICS.

### UNIX is a character based OS. It has been modified into a GUI based OS called LINUX. LINUX was developed by a person named `Linus Torvalds`.
##### Different versions of LINUX are,

* Red Hat
* Mandrake (HP) 
* Fedora Core
* Ubuntu
* SUSE

## UNIX File System

> All files in UNIX are related to one another. The file system in UNIX is a collection of all these related files organized in a hierarchical (inverted tree like structure).

> Every UNIX file system has a top, which serves as the reference point for all files. This top is called `root` and is represented by a frontslash (/). Root is actually a directory.

> The root directory has a number of subdirectories under it. These subdirectories in turn have other sub directories under them.

> Every file, apart from the root , must have a parent and thus it should be possible to trace the ultimate parentage of a file to a root.

* `Root` – it is the starting directory for Unix OS. Denoted by / 

* `Etc` – contains all configuration files of Unix OS.

* `Dev` – contains all device files like drivers.
    * A device file or special file is an interface for a device driver that appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary file. There are also special device files in MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. They allow software to interact with a device driver using standard input/output system calls, which simplifies many tasks and unifies user-space I/O mechanisms. Device files often provide simple interfaces to peripheral devices, such as printers.

* `Bin` – stands for ‘binary’. Contains binary files. Binary files are files which can be run i.e, they are executable files.

* `Lib` – stands for ‘library files’. It contains all re-usable programs/data.

* `Temp` – just for temporary storage. Similar to recycle bin where we can store unwanted files.

* `Lost & found` – same as ‘restore’. Lost files or directories are stored here. When we are working on Unix and there is a power shutdown. If we wish to recover the documents we were earlier working on, then they can be found in lost&found directory.

* `Mnt` – stands for ‘mount’. Used for mounting external devices. It is also used for connecting external storage devices like – HDD(hard disk drive), USB, DVD, C etc.


> UNIX OS supports multiple users at any given point of time. The users of UNIX will be assigned a separate directory known as home directory. 

> Each user of UNIX OS has their own username & password and separate home directory.

> When a user is logged into UNIX OS, the default working directory will be user home directory.

> A user directory is used for installation of a s/w which can be used by all the users of the UNIX OS.
