> **The `git clone` command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a `server` to the `local machine`**

## to Clone a GitHub Project
```
cd <path where you would like the clone to create a directory> 

git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git
```

## To clone a BitBucket project
```
cd <path where you would like the clone to create a directory>

git clone https://yourusername@bitbucket.org/username/projectname.git
```

## To specify a different name of the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git MyFolder
```

## to clone in the current directory
```
