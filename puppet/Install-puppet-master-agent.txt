pre steps on both Master & Agent

	configure hostsnames in /etc/hosts file on both instances

	on master node 
		vi /etc/hosts
			<master ip> puppet
			
	on agent server
		vi /etc/hosts
			<master ip> puppet
			
		put hostname of the master node as "puppet" because by default the agents try to contact this name.

Master Setup:
-------
		curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
		dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
		apt-get update
		apt-get install puppetserver

		By default, Puppet Server is configured to use 2 GB of RAM. You can customize this setting based on how much free memory the master server has and how many agent nodes it will manage.
		To customize it, open /etc/default/puppetserver.

		JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

		FYI Only: When we start Puppet Server, it will use port 8140 to communicate, so we'll ensure it's open:


		systemctl start puppetserver
		systemctl status puppetserver
		systemctl enable puppetserver  # for enabling boot time start time


Agent:
------

		wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
		dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
		apt-get update
		apt-get install puppet-agent
		systemctl start puppet
		systemctl status puppet


		setting up master agent communictaion 

Certificate Signing:
-------------------

		/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list   # on Master

		Now sign it

		/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign hostname  # u can find the hostname in certlist also


		The Puppet master can now communicate and control the node that the signed certificate belongs to. 
		You can also sign all current requests at once.

		We'll use the --all option to sign the remaining certificate:

		 /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign --all
		 
		Version :   dpkg -l | grep puppet
